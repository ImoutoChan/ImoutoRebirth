# What is ImoutoRebirth

ImoutoRebirth is a solution for organizing media files with a focus on anime images. It is inspired and deeply integrated with sites such as danbooru.donmai.us, yande.re, gelbooru.com.

I started writing it for myself many years ago because I am an avid image saver. Over time, different functions came together into a comprehensive solution, and I decided to publish it.

ImoutoRebirth will be most useful for those who love saving images (a lot of images) and then want to be able to sort through and find the ones they need, which is usually extremely challenging without tags.

Key features:

- Collections of files (images, videos, GIFs)
- Supported formats include
    - jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, tiff, apng, gif, webp, jfif
    - mp4, mov, webm, wmv, mov, m2ts, mpg, mpeg, mkv, f4v, flv, avi, m4v, swf
    - zip as pixiv ugoira
- Background search and updating of tags for your images and metadata based on file hash from danbooru, sankaku, yande.re, gelbooru
- Local search for saved files and their tags
- Bulk tagging of files
- Display of notes from boorus on local images
- Automatic download of favorites from boorus to your collection
- Highlighting of saved images in the browser

## What does ImoutoRebirth look like

There are two windows desktop applications available for you.

### Imouto Navigator

For viewing and managing collections, and tagging. It's essentially an explorer.

### ImoutoRebirth Viewer

For viewing individual images. Its use is not mandatory, you can use your favorite image viewer, but Imouto Viewer allows you to read Notes from booru (usually these are translations of text in images), view and add your own tags.

## ImoutoRebirth Architecture

Beyond the two applications mentioned earlier, ImoutoRebirth internally consists of a bunch of services, each with its own function. These will be installed automatically, and no particular knowledge about them is required. However, for the inquisitive, this section describes the inner workings and purposes of different services, as well as their dependencies. If you follow the installation instructions below, these services will be automatically installed as Windows Services. Also, for the system to operate, Postgres and RabbitMQ will be needed. You can install them independently or use the scripts provided with each release.

You can overview the basic architecture and the interaction of services in greater detail in [this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MD8NAIeuV8u_wt9HWjdUUrcOaiZOMNBF/view?usp=drive_link), open it with diagrams.net or draw.io.

### ImoutoRebirth.Room
This service is responsible for interacting with the file system. It is the one that stores your collections, moves files, checks for duplicates, calculates and compares md5 hashes. Configuring collections from Imouto Navigator calls methods specifically in it.

### ImoutoRebirth.Arachne
This service handles interactions with the outside world and collects tags and metadata. Receiving tasks asynchronously (for instance, when you save a new file), it accesses the known sites and downloads tags, notes, and metadata from them. It also manages tag updates, tracking changes that the sites typically publish as a feed. Ideally, you should always have up-to-date tags locally, just like on the websites.

### ImoutoRebirth.Lilin
This service is responsible for storing and searching tags. The results of Arachne's work and the tags you add yourself are stored here.

### ImoutoRebirth.Meido
This coordinating service monitors the processes occurring in the system and assigns tasks to Arachne for searching or updating tags.

### ImoutoRebirth.Harpy
This mini-service downloads favs from your site accounts and stores them in the specified folder.

### ImoutoRebirth.Kekkai
This API gateway proxies requests to internal services and allows you to check whether specific images are stored in the system. For example, Imouto Extensions uses it.

### ImoutoRebirth.Tori
This service won't run or be installed in your system, as it's an updater service for the new version.

# Installation

1. Download ImoutoRebirth.exe to any folder
2. Run it (this is a self-extracting 7z archive), it will unpack the application into the "latest" folder, copy the path to this folder
3. Edit configuration.json, filling it with your data
4. Run Powershell as an administrator
5. Execute the commands below in order:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
```

```powershell
cd <path to the latest folder>
``` 

This will install rabbitmq, postgres, .net runtime
```powershell
./install-dependencies.ps1
```

This will install or update the application itself
```powershell
./install-update.ps1
```
